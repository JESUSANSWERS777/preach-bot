# Preach Bot
Preach Bot is a Twitter bot that reads verses from the bible. It reads one verse every 15 minutes.

## Lifetime
With 96 verses each day and 31102 verses in the King James Bible, it will take just under (31102/96â‰ˆ) 324 days for Preach Bot to finish off. Which makes you pretty happy to not be in Sunday School.

## Details
Preach Bot uses Tweepy to talk to the Twitter API and Heroku to let the application run in the cloud.

## Purpose
This is mainly a proof-of-concept project and I hope to design some more complicated Twitter and chat bots in the future. Also, I forget how long the bible is and forget about all the weird parts. I would like to read it all through at some point but in the meantime I've got a bot do it for me.
